      <h3>Managing Your Project</h3>
      <p>
          There will be on-site supervisor and my personal supervision to ensure what we agree on paper is essentially
          what we deliver, and you will have a timely update on the proceeds. We coordinate with all the sub contractors,
          for example, electricials, plumbers, civil workers etc., based on the sequence of work needed.
      </p>
      <p>
          We take care of your home (even during execution period) essentially by making sure all wood work is executed off site,
          our workers do not stay at the site which avoids workers using bathrooms, kitchen etc., at the project site.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h3>Selecting Material</h3>
      <p>
          We get atleast two quotes from capable/competitve vendors, verify each quote before we request you to sign off.
          We also ensure contract terms with each vendor is clearly mentioned, and their deliverables written in accordance
          with the fit and finish as discussed/agreed during design phase.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h3>Selecting Vendor</h3>
      <p>
          We go with what&apos;s best for the project. Unlike the general market practices, we do not accept kickbacks or commissions
          from any vendor. All our special discounts (a min of 10% upto 30% that we get as architects) are passed onto our clients.
          We are transparent on all our transactions and are unbiased towards our recommendations.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h3>The Buck Stops At Our Table</h3>
      <p>
          We take a full responsibility of the project from design until the styling and set up your home. While you work with us,
          you will be coordinating with me directly, unlike otherwise where a junior architect who is assigned to the project. We
          ensure this by choosing our projects and not taking more than what we are capable of handling at a particular time.
          This way, we assure the process of making your home an enjoyable experience.
      </p>
      <p>
          Furthermore, it&apos;s a relationship we build with all our clients that does not stop at the closure of a project but continues,
          to ensure you always have your home the way it is meant to be.
